default sizing and scaling in html website :

for font: 16px font size (equal as 1em)
NB : bad idea for resizing or scaling some of other default scale(important) etc: font-size : 62.5% , make 1em change to 10px; alternate it using percent for scaling also used, but some cases it's terrible;
font stack also important cause not all font use the same scaling, change the base font size and line height to suit needs;

for responsive website: 

common break point for scale
1. 320px - Mobile Portrait
2. 480px - Mobile Landscape
3. 600px - Small Tablet
4. 768px - Tablet Portrait
5. 1024px - Tablet Landscape/Netbook
6. 1280px & greater - Desktop

NB: use @mediascreen and (min-width: x){} if needed

these are my mind map about making a beatiful website
